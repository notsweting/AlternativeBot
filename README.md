# AlternativeBot
Repository for @AlternativeBot#3969 on Discord.

UPDATE OCT 1 2021
------------------
Returning to fix this mess and also just to gitignore the important parts

~~UPDATE AUG 9 2021~~
------------------
~~I have decided to stop updating the repository. Unfortunately, because there are certain things that must be made closed source, updating the repo would break the bot. The repo will stay up, just no longer updated.~~

Invite link for the bot soon.

The bot can be found on discord with the following links:
https://discord.gg/33utps9
https://discord.gg/dpy

Changelogs are found on the support server, discord invite 33utPs9.
Bug reports are handled first on the support server (https://discord.gg/33utps9) however a better organized tracker is available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GtvZwKXOMCfZYyvKtqxwZuzbDL-RJkvq_OkxLYN2IK4/edit#gid=0.
